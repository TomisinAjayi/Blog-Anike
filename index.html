                <h2>My Top Books Of 2018</h2>
                <h5>December 28, 2018 / Bukola Ajayi</h5>
                <p>
                  Book lover here, I think I have read over 50 books this year. I enjoy reading but not school books tho. I usually just search for the book in Pdf format or ebook then download it.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So, I was going through a phase <b>“the learning how to save money phase”</b> but it didn’t work out and that’s when I read these two books
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>The Smart Money Woman by Arese Ugwu.</b> 
                      It was my roomate that recommended this book to me and i fell in love with it instantly. I even sent the author a mail but didn’t get a feedback. It’s about a lagos big girl having financial problems and also finding love. It’s kind of cute.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Richest Man in Babylon.</b> 
                      This is another book that teaches you how to be smarter with your money. I took a class on book publishing and we were asked to right a summary on the book. The book talks about saving, investing and gives advice on how become a successful business man.                    
                      <br><br>
                      Some of the other books I read for fun this year <span id="dots">...</span>
                    </li>
                    <span id="more">
                      <li>
                        <b>After.</b> 
                        it is a trilogy on wattpad, and apparently they are making a movie. It is like the high school version of Fifty Shades. The trilogy was so frustrating and exhausting (that’s how their love life was) but i couldn’t stop reading it, I hated the ending so much. By the way, they are making a movie and the thriller looks trash. I don’t like the cast at all.                  
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Fifty Shades Triology.</b> 
                        I am addicted to fifty shades, i don’t know why i love it so much. I have read the books over 20 times, at a point i knew it chapter by chapter lol (if only i knew my textbooks like this). I think my best among the three movies is fifty shades freed. I didn’t like darker at all, they removed all the interesting scenes i wanted to see. And the soundtrack in freed is amazing i still listen to it.             
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Game of Thrones.</b> 
                        Just because if i love a movie so much, i like to read the book. The books and the series are a little bit different. It’s more detailed in the books but they are so annoying to read, the words are so tiny but i prefer watching it tho. My favorite character is Cersei. I’m so excited for the final season,i think i might cry. i wonder who the Night king is, i think it might be Rhaegar Targayen.
