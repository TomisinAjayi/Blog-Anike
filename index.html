          <h2>My Top Books Of 2018</h2>
          <h5>December 28, 2018 / Bukola Ajayi</h5>
          <p>
            Book lover here, I think I have read over 50 books this year. I enjoy reading but not school books tho. I usually just search for the book in Pdf format or ebook then download it.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, I was going through a phase <b>“the learning how to save money phase”</b> but it didn’t work out and that’s when I read these two books
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The Smart Money Woman by Arese Ugwu.</b> 
                It was my roomate that recommended this book to me and i fell in love with it instantly. I even sent the author a mail but didn’t get a feedback. It’s about a lagos big girl having financial problems and also finding love. It’s kind of cute.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Richest Man in Babylon.</b> 
                This is another book that teaches you how to be smarter with your money. I took a class on book publishing and we were asked to right a summary on the book. The book talks about saving, investing and gives advice on how become a successful business man.                    
                <br><br>
                Some of the other books I read for fun this year <span class="dots">...</span>
              </li>
              <span class="more">
                <li>
                  <b>After.</b> 
                  it is a trilogy on wattpad, and apparently they are making a movie. It is like the high school version of Fifty Shades. The trilogy was so frustrating and exhausting (that’s how their love life was) but i couldn’t stop reading it, I hated the ending so much. By the way, they are making a movie and the thriller looks trash. I don’t like the cast at all.                  
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Fifty Shades Triology.</b> 
                  I am addicted to fifty shades, i don’t know why i love it so much. I have read the books over 20 times, at a point i knew it chapter by chapter lol (if only i knew my textbooks like this). I think my best among the three movies is fifty shades freed. I didn’t like darker at all, they removed all the interesting scenes i wanted to see. And the soundtrack in freed is amazing i still listen to it.             
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Game of Thrones.</b> 
                  Just because if i love a movie so much, i like to read the book. The books and the series are a little bit different. It’s more detailed in the books but they are so annoying to read, the words are so tiny but i prefer watching it tho. My favorite character is Cersei. I’m so excited for the final season,i think i might cry. i wonder who the Night king is, i think it might be Rhaegar Targayen.
                  <br>
                  <br>                    
                  P.S. If you’re interested in any book let me know I will send it to your mail. xoxo.</p>

          <h2>About the start of my Blog “The gist with Anike”</h2>
          <h5>August 24, 2020 / Bukola Ajayi</h5>
          <p>
            I was at my desk with no work to do during my internship in the year 2018. I felt everyone around me was doing something with their lives whether it is creating content on Instagram or starting up businesses of their own. I looked at myself and thought “Bukky what are you doing” then I realised I actually had nothing going. I was just sitting by my desk waiting for it to be 6 o’clock so I could go home.
            <br>
            <br>
            I went on the internet and decided thought it would be nice to be able to write about my thoughts. I began searching for an online journal app but I could not find anything I loved. Then I came across WordPress and decided to make it my journal site. A blog where I could just type whatever I thought and publish it. But then, a thought also crossed my mind that I will be letting strangers in on what is going on in my head. I said to myself “It’s time to let everyone see what you think about”<span class="dots">...</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="more">
                I started with basic topics and after while I created the journal section of the blog.
                It has been really cool so far, I never expected that there would be people who would love what I wrote and not to mention that some people will actually subscribe.
                After the blog creation, I went ahead to apply for jobs and I ended up getting one. This blog just seemed like a starting point for me and made me realise that once you set your mind on something you can actually get it.
                <br> <br>
                Also, it doesn’t hurt to try new things. It literally does not hurt.
                <br> <br>
                P.s. I wrote this for a job application because I was asked to write a story on something and I decided to post it here because why not?
                <br> <br>
                Stay safe guys and also don’t forget to smile today.
